The Reports API section of the Amazon Marketplace Web Service (Amazon MWS) API lets you request various reports 
that help you manage your Sell on Amazon business. Report types are specified using the ReportTypes enumeration.
Amazon periodically adds new fields and field values to reports. Be sure to build report parsers into your 
Amazon MWS applications that can gracefully handle these types of report updates.

The report process begins by creating a report request. 
Next, you obtain a list of report requests which shows the report request identifier and status of each requested 
report. Finally, you use the report request identifier from this listing to get the actual report.

Submit a report request using the RequestReport operation. 
This is a request to Amazon MWS to generate a specific report. 
Note that you can also schedule order report requests to be submitted periodically using the ManageReportSchedule operation.
